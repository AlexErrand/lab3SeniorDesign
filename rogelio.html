            <p>Hello I'm Rogelio Valle (roh-heh-lee-oh) and I am a senior at the University of Iowa studing Computer Science and Engineering. 
                I am orignally from north central Illinois and I have three other siblings. Whenever I find free time I 
                like to keep up with Iowa sports and go to the gym.

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>
                During the summer between my junior year and senior year I worked an internship with Walmart in their
                Silicon Valley campus. When I was here I got to experience a multitude of new things such as the inner
                workings of a large "tech" company. At my time at Walmart I worked on an internal API that would enable
                an international shipping pipeline. As far as I am currently aware my work was pused to production. As 
                far as I am currently aware if you order something in Canada and your packaged is shipped from the US
                you would be using my pipeline.

                One of my favourite things to do is take a nice picture. I have always admired photography and it is my 
                favourite gen ed I have taken. Some of My favourite spotrs in Iowa City to take pictures are the Hillcrest
                river view, the Ped Mall throughout the seasonal changes, and T Anne Clearly during different times of day.
                You may be surprised how different pictures of the same place can be and I believe its poetic. 
                When I was in California I was constantly overwhelmed by the amount of 
                beautiful scenery there to take pictures of. The picture above is a picture of myself in front of a 
                valley on the drive to Yosemite. The picture below is El Capitan which you may recognize from Mac OS
                wallpapers.
