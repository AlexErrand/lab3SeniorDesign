            <p>Hello I'm Rogelio Valle (roh-heh-lee-oh) and I am a senior at the University of Iowa studing Computer Science and Engineering. 
                I am orignally from north central Illinois and I have three other siblings. Whenever I find free time I 
                like to keep up with Iowa sports and go to the gym. I am also fluent in spanish.

                During the summer between my junior year and senior year I worked an internship with Walmart in their
                Silicon Valley campus. When I was here I got to experience a multitude of new things such as the inner
                workings of a large "tech" company. At my time at Walmart I worked on an internal API that would enable
                an international shipping pipeline. As far as I am currently aware my work was pused to production. As 
                far as I am currently aware if you order something in Canada and your packaged is shipped from the US
                you would be using my pipeline.

                I have also participated in the University of Iowa hackathon two times. Both times I have received awards 
                for the projects I participated in. Tradgy, a mapping of "tragic" events found by scraping twitter, was my 
                first hackathon. My second hackathon was Geobound, a task list that uses location to make sure you are staying 
                committed. Both of these projects can be found on my <p><a href="https://github.com/RedJelloooo">Github</a></p>

                One of my favourite things to do is take a nice picture. I have always admired photography and it is my 
                favourite gen ed I have taken. Some of My favourite spotrs in Iowa City to take pictures are the Hillcrest
                river view, the Ped Mall throughout the seasonal changes, and T Anne Clearly during different times of day.
                You may be surprised how different pictures of the same place can be and I believe its poetic. 
                When I was in California I was constantly overwhelmed by the amount of 
                beautiful scenery there to take pictures of. The picture above is a picture of myself in front of a 
                valley on the drive to Yosemite. The picture below is El Capitan which you may recognize from Mac OS
                wallpapers.
